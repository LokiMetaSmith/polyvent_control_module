There were a few issues with the old control module that we have to discuss:

The production of a current control module takes many steps, mostly involving wiring and the installation and modification of boards and modules.
certain parts are unnecessarily complex, and can be simplified by a lot. A microcontroller is not needed on the valves board
it is not very easy to use, so it should be better documented, and maybe have it use an Arduino nano instead of a standalone atmega328p, to solve bootloading and programming issues.
To improve modularity, I can also add blank modules, for further prototyping of future designs.

My solution is to create a new control module, where each individual submodule connects into a backplane, it'll look a bit like the gpu slots on a modern pc. This solves the wiring issue. The valves board will get a shift register instead of an Arduino microcontroller, which will mean that it doesn't need to be programmed, this will improve its reliability. Blank modules will also be created. So far, I want to create a main board module, a power supply module, a battery module, a motor board module, a valves control module, and a blank prototyping module.
